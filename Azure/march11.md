## Dump

- Azure functions are fast, serverless achitecture, which can be triggered.
- Event grid takes an function and has only trigger compatibility.

- Azure functions are fun and have kafka inbuilt
- they are super clean and I mean it.
- I have captured webhooks, hit oracle apis, and intracted with sql dbs with some lines of code.
